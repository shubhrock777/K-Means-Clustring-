# K-Means-Clustring-
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.


1st 

1.)	Perform clustering (K means clustering) for the airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters. Draw the inferences from the clusters obtained. Refer to EastWestAirlines.xlsx dataset.
 
2nd

2.)	Perform clustering for the crime data and identify the number of clusters formed and draw inferences. Refer to crime_data.csv dataset.

3rd

3.)	Analyze the information given in the following ‘Insurance Policy dataset’ to create clusters of persons falling in the same type. Refer to Insurance Dataset.csv


4th 

4.)	Perform clustering analysis on the telecom dataset. The data is a mixture of both categorical and numerical data. It consists the number of customers who churn. Derive insights and get possible information on factors that may affect the churn decision. Refer to Telco_customer_churn.xlsx dataset.
Hint: 
•	Perform EDA and remove unwanted columns.
•	Use Gower dissimilarity matrix and  In R use daisy() function.
